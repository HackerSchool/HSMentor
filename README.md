## Development Container

In order to help the development of the backend, we created a development container. Most modern text editors and IDEs support dev containers, and you can see how to use them here:

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)**

- **[JetBrains IDEs (PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA, Rider)](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/connect-to-devcontainer.html)**
